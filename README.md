## Description

This is a Firefox extension that communicates with a Python backend to provide integration with the Awesome window manager.

The extension was made in order to move the firefox tabs into the awesome wm titlebar and to make it show up in the window switcher, Theres other ways you could implement it but these are the main reasons I made it

The code to implement it on the awesomewm side can be found here,
